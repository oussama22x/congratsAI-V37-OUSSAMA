# Prevent Duplicate Audition Applications - Implementation

## Overview
Users can now only apply to each audition opportunity once. The system prevents duplicate applications at both the database and frontend levels.

## Features Implemented

### ✅ 1. Database-Level Protection
**Already exists in schema:**
```sql
UNIQUE(user_id, opportunity_id) -- One submission per user per opportunity
```
- This constraint in `audition_submissions` table prevents duplicate entries at the database level
- If a duplicate is attempted, the database will reject it

### ✅ 2. Frontend Submission Tracking
**New State Management:**
```typescript
const [userSubmissions, setUserSubmissions] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set());
```
- Tracks which opportunity IDs the user has already applied to
- Uses a Set for O(1) lookup performance
- Fetched on component mount

### ✅ 3. Fetch User's Applications
**New useEffect:**
- Fetches all submissions for the current user
- Extracts opportunity IDs into a Set
- Updates `userSubmissions` state
```typescript
const response = await fetch(`${BACKEND_URL}/api/submissions?userId=${currentUser.id}`);
```

### ✅ 4. Prevent Duplicate Starts
**Updated `handleStartAudition`:**
```typescript
if (userSubmissions.has(opportunity.id)) {
  toast({
    title: "Already Applied",
    description: "You have already submitted an audition for this opportunity.",
    variant: "destructive",
  });
  return;
}
```
- Checks if user has already applied before opening modal
- Shows toast notification if already applied
- Prevents modal from opening

### ✅ 5. Visual Indicators
**OpportunityCard Updates:**
- Added `hasApplied` prop (boolean)
- Shows green "Applied" badge in card header
- Disables "Start Audition" button
- Button shows "Already Applied" with checkmark icon

**UI Changes:**
```typescript
{hasApplied && (
  <Badge variant="default" className="bg-green-600">
    <CheckCircle2 className="h-3 w-3" />
    Applied
  </Badge>
)}

{hasApplied ? (
  <Button disabled variant="secondary">
    <CheckCircle2 className="h-4 w-4 mr-2" />
    Already Applied
  </Button>
) : (
  <Button onClick={onStartAudition}>
    Start Audition
  </Button>
)}
```

### ✅ 6. Real-Time State Update
**After Submission:**
- When user completes an audition, the opportunity ID is immediately added to `userSubmissions`
- UI updates instantly without needing to refetch
- Card shows "Applied" badge and disabled button

## Files Modified

### 1. **Opportunities.tsx**
- Added `userSubmissions` state (Set<string>)
- Added `submissionsLoading` state
- Added useEffect to fetch user submissions
- Updated `handleStartAudition` with duplicate check
- Updated `handleQuestionsComplete` to add to submissions set
- Pass `hasApplied` prop to OpportunityCard

### 2. **OpportunityCard.tsx**
- Added `hasApplied` prop to interface
- Added "Applied" badge in header
- Conditionally render button (disabled if applied)
- Import CheckCircle2 icon

### 3. **Backend (No Changes Needed)**
- Database constraint already exists
- API endpoint `/api/submissions?userId=<id>` already exists
- Will automatically reject duplicates if attempted

## User Flow

### Scenario 1: First Time Applying
```
1. User sees opportunity card
   ↓
2. "Start Audition" button enabled
   ↓
3. User completes audition
   ↓
4. Submission saved to database
   ↓
5. Opportunity ID added to userSubmissions Set
   ↓
6. Card updates to show "Applied" badge
   ↓
7. Button disabled with "Already Applied" text
```

### Scenario 2: Already Applied
```
1. User loads Opportunities page
   ↓
2. Fetch user's submissions
   ↓
3. Cards render with "Applied" badges
   ↓
4. Buttons are disabled
   ↓
5. If user clicks anyway, toast notification shows
   ↓
6. Modal doesn't open
```

### Scenario 3: Attempting Duplicate (Shouldn't Happen)
```
1. User somehow bypasses frontend checks
   ↓
2. Submits audition answers
   ↓
3. Backend creates submission
   ↓
4. Database UNIQUE constraint catches it
   ↓
5. Error returned to frontend
   ↓
6. User sees error message
```

## Console Logs

**On Page Load:**
```
✅ User has applied to opportunities: ["uuid-1", "uuid-2", ...]
📊 Total applications: 2
```

**When Trying to Apply Again:**
```
(Toast notification appears: "Already Applied")
```

**After New Submission:**
```
✅ Submission created with ID: <uuid>
📝 Added opportunity to applied list
```

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Visual Indicators
1. ✅ Go to Opportunities page
2. ✅ Look for opportunities with green "Applied" badge
3. ✅ Verify button shows "Already Applied" (disabled)

### Test 2: Prevent Click
1. ✅ Try clicking "Already Applied" button
2. ✅ Should do nothing (button is disabled)

### Test 3: Fresh Application
1. ✅ Find opportunity without "Applied" badge
2. ✅ Click "Start Audition"
3. ✅ Complete audition
4. ✅ Return to Opportunities
5. ✅ Verify badge appears on that opportunity
6. ✅ Verify button is now disabled

### Test 4: Attempt Duplicate
1. ✅ Find applied opportunity
2. ✅ Try to click "Start Audition" (should be disabled)
3. ✅ Verify toast notification if somehow clicked

### Test 5: Refresh Page
1. ✅ Apply to opportunity
2. ✅ Refresh page
3. ✅ Verify "Applied" badge still appears
4. ✅ Verify button still disabled
5. ✅ (Submissions are fetched from database)

## Edge Cases Handled

### ✅ 1. User Not Logged In
- `currentUser.id` will be undefined
- Submissions fetch won't run
- All cards show "Start Audition" (enabled)

### ✅ 2. Fetch Fails
- Error is logged but not shown to user
- User can still see opportunities
- Applied status won't show (graceful degradation)

### ✅ 3. Race Condition
- Database UNIQUE constraint is final safeguard
- Even if frontend state is wrong, DB will prevent duplicate

### ✅ 4. Multiple Tabs
- Each tab fetches submissions independently
- After submission in one tab, other tab won't know
- But database will reject if user tries in other tab
- Solution: User can refresh to update

## Benefits

1. **Better UX**: Users immediately know which opportunities they've applied to
2. **Prevent Mistakes**: Can't accidentally reapply
3. **Data Integrity**: Database constraint ensures no duplicates
4. **Performance**: Set-based lookup is O(1)
5. **Visual Feedback**: Clear "Applied" badges
6. **Accessibility**: Disabled buttons can't be activated

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

### 1. Application Status
Show more than just "Applied":
- "Under Review"
- "Interview Scheduled"
- "Accepted"
- "Rejected"

### 2. Reapply After Rejection
Allow reapplication if status is "rejected":
```typescript
const canReapply = submission.status === 'rejected';
```

### 3. Real-Time Updates
Use WebSockets or polling to update across tabs:
```typescript
// Broadcast to other tabs
localStorage.setItem('newSubmission', opportunityId);
window.addEventListener('storage', handleStorageChange);
```

### 4. Application Count
Show how many times user has applied:
```typescript
<p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
  You have applied to {userSubmissions.size} opportunities
</p>
```

## Summary

✅ Users can only apply to each opportunity once
✅ Visual indicators show applied status
✅ Buttons are disabled for applied opportunities
✅ Toast notification prevents accidental clicks
✅ Database constraint is final safeguard
✅ State updates in real-time after submission
✅ No backend changes needed (constraint exists)
✅ Graceful error handling
✅ Works across page refreshes

The duplicate prevention system is complete and ready to test! 🎯✨
