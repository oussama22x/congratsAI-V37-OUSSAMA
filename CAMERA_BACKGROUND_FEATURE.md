# Background Camera Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
The camera now stays active throughout the entire audition process, displaying a live feed in the top-right corner. The camera stream is NOT recorded or stored - it only runs in the background for proctoring visibility.

## Changes Made

### 1. **SystemCheckStep.tsx**
- ✅ Modified `onStart` callback to pass `MediaStream` to parent
- ✅ Added `auditionStarted` state to prevent premature cleanup
- ✅ Camera stream is kept alive when audition starts
- ✅ Stream reference is passed up the component tree

**Key Changes:**
```typescript
// Before
onStart: () => void;
// After
onStart: (cameraStream: MediaStream | null) => void;

// Keeps stream alive
const handleStartAudition = () => {
  console.log("🎥 Keeping camera stream active for audition");
  setAuditionStarted(true);
  onStart(streamRef.current);
};
```

### 2. **AuditionStartModal.tsx**
- ✅ Updated to accept and forward camera stream
- ✅ Passes stream from SystemCheckStep to parent Opportunities page

**Interface Update:**
```typescript
interface AuditionStartModalProps {
  onStart: (cameraStream: MediaStream | null) => void;
}
```

### 3. **BackgroundCamera.tsx** (NEW COMPONENT)
- ✅ Displays live camera feed in corner of screen
- ✅ Configurable position: top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right
- ✅ Configurable size: sm, md, lg
- ✅ Shows "LIVE" indicator with red pulsing dot
- ✅ Hover effect shows camera icon
- ✅ Does NOT record or store video

**Features:**
```typescript
<BackgroundCamera 
  stream={cameraStream}      // MediaStream from camera
  position="top-right"       // Position on screen
  size="sm"                  // Small, medium, or large
  showIndicator={true}       // Show LIVE badge
/>
```

### 4. **AuditionQuestionScreen.tsx**
- ✅ Accepts optional `cameraStream` prop
- ✅ Renders `BackgroundCamera` component during audition
- ✅ Camera visible on all question screens

**Updated Interface:**
```typescript
interface AuditionQuestionScreenProps {
  cameraStream?: MediaStream | null;
}
```

### 5. **Opportunities.tsx**
- ✅ Manages camera stream with `useRef` hook
- ✅ Passes stream through component tree
- ✅ Cleans up stream on:
  - Modal close (without starting audition)
  - Audition completion
  - Component unmount
  - Return to dashboard

**Stream Management:**
```typescript
const cameraStreamRef = useRef<MediaStream | null>(null);

// Start audition with camera
const handleBeginAudition = (cameraStream: MediaStream | null) => {
  cameraStreamRef.current = cameraStream;
  setAuditionInProgress(true);
};

// Cleanup on complete
const handleQuestionsComplete = async () => {
  if (cameraStreamRef.current) {
    cameraStreamRef.current.getTracks().forEach(track => track.stop());
    cameraStreamRef.current = null;
  }
  // ... rest of completion logic
};
```

## How It Works

### Flow Diagram:
```
1. User clicks "Start Audition"
   ↓
2. SystemCheckStep requests camera permission
   ↓
3. Camera preview shown in modal
   ↓
4. User clicks "Start Audition" button
   ↓
5. Camera stream passed to Opportunities page (NOT stopped)
   ↓
6. AuditionQuestionScreen receives camera stream
   ↓
7. BackgroundCamera component displays feed in corner
   ↓
8. Camera runs throughout all questions
   ↓
9. On completion, stream is stopped and cleaned up
```

### Camera Lifecycle:

**Initialization:**
- Camera requested in `SystemCheckStep`
- Permission granted by user
- Stream attached to video preview

**During Audition:**
- Stream kept alive (tracks not stopped)
- Displayed in top-right corner
- Visible on all question screens
- NOT recorded or stored

**Cleanup:**
- Stream stopped when:
  - User closes modal before starting
  - Audition completes
  - User returns to dashboard
  - Component unmounts

## Visual Appearance

The background camera appears as a small video feed:
- 📍 **Position**: Top-right corner (configurable)
- 📏 **Size**: Small (128x96px) - configurable to medium or large
- 🎨 **Style**: Rounded corners, border, shadow
- 🔴 **Indicator**: Red pulsing dot with "LIVE" text
- 🎥 **Mirror**: Video is horizontally flipped (selfie view)
- 🖱️ **Hover**: Shows camera icon overlay

## Console Logs

You'll see these logs during the flow:

**Camera Setup:**
```
🎥 Requesting camera access...
✅ Camera access granted
📺 Attaching stream to video element...
✅ Video playing
```

**Audition Start:**
```
🎥 Keeping camera stream active for audition
🎬 Beginning audition with camera stream: MediaStream
```

**Background Camera:**
```
🎥 BackgroundCamera: Attaching stream to video element
```

**Cleanup:**
```
🧹 Cleaning up camera stream (audition complete)
🛑 Stopped camera track: <track label>
```

## Important Notes

### ⚠️ Privacy & Security
- Camera is NOT recorded
- No video data is stored
- No frames are captured
- Stream is only displayed locally
- Purely for visual proctoring

### ✅ Browser Compatibility
- Works in Chrome, Firefox, Edge
- Requires HTTPS or localhost
- Needs camera permission granted

### 🎯 Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)
If you want to add recording later:
- Could capture snapshots at intervals
- Could record full video
- Could send frames to backend for analysis
- Could use ML for behavior detection

But currently: **NO RECORDING - JUST LIVE DISPLAY**

## Testing

### Test the Feature:
1. ✅ Go to Opportunities page
2. ✅ Click "Start Audition" on any opportunity
3. ✅ Click "Next: System Check"
4. ✅ Allow camera permission
5. ✅ See camera preview in modal
6. ✅ Click "Start Audition"
7. ✅ Camera should appear in top-right corner
8. ✅ Camera stays visible through all questions
9. ✅ Complete audition
10. ✅ Verify camera stops (LED light off)

### Verify Cleanup:
- Close modal before starting → camera stops ✅
- Complete full audition → camera stops ✅
- Return to dashboard → camera stops ✅
- Refresh page during audition → camera stops ✅

## Files Modified

```
✅ src/components/SystemCheckStep.tsx
✅ src/components/AuditionStartModal.tsx
✅ src/components/AuditionQuestionScreen.tsx
✅ src/pages/talent/Opportunities.tsx
🆕 src/components/BackgroundCamera.tsx (new file)
```

## Code Quality

- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ Proper cleanup on unmount
- ✅ Memory leak prevention
- ✅ Comprehensive logging
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Type safety throughout

## Summary

The camera now works as a **non-recording background proctoring feature**:
- ✅ Stays on during entire audition
- ✅ Visible in corner (not intrusive)
- ✅ NOT recorded or stored
- ✅ Proper cleanup when done
- ✅ Professional appearance
- ✅ Ready for production use

The implementation is complete and ready to test! 🎥✨
